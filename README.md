In this project we had to build a basic but fully functional BlackJack game using Javascript. I customized the background color to look similar to the project example by using a pool-like background. I also customized some of the font and font color and modified some of the game messages, such as when you get blackjack or after you've lost. I think the main thing I struggled with on this project was a certain bug that prevented you from getting a new card after you've gotten blackjack and began a new game, but besides that it was pretty much smooth sailing.
